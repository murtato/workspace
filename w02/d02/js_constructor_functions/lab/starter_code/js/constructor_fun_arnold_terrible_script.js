shotgun! Batman sends out three henchmen to take out Conan. */

	// Have a gunfight in the streets of gotham!
	// Make sure Conan wins!

/* Conan was bloodied and bruised, but he was ready for more. Batman looked down
on him from a steeple. He called out

"Hey Arnold! You won't make it out of these streets alive."

"I'm Conan now! But I've done nothing to you! Why all de death, Batman?" replied
Arnold.

"It's not what you've done - it's what you did do in the future."

Conan was confused. How could he have done something in the future?

He realized, if he was going to make it out of this alive, he needed bigger
weapons. */

/* ACT 3 */

 of Conan to defeat his nemesis. */

	// Create 7 terminators

/* Conan received a mysterious letter in the mail from a CW that showed a map
to the Batcave.  With dynamite in hand, Conan felt ready to take on the Batman.

However, just to be safe, he decided to have a cell phone where he could call his
friends. */

	// Make sure they have a scream and a health key.
	// Make sure each reference the arnold object as a bestFriend property

	// Create 3 friends
	// Make sure one of them is Carl Weathers

/* Conan goes to the batcave with his cellphone and dynamite. And an enormous
battle ensues. */


	// Create a fight between Conan and terminators
	// When Conan's health gets low, bring in his friends!

	// Defeat the terminators (bring their health down to 0).

/* Conan has batman cornered. He's hurt, and isn't going anywhere.

"Why did you kill my parents? Why are you so set on fighting me?" bellowed Arnold.

"You ruined me Conan Arnold - you destroyed the idea of Batman. You will turn us
into a joke when you play Mr. Freeze!"

Conan was hurt - he had no idea his future would hurt Batman so bad.

In fact, he was so hurt, he decided to ice Batman.
*/


	// push "What killed de Dinosaurs? DE ICE AGE!" to arnold.oneLiners
	// Add an ice method to arnold that brings an enemy down to zero and
	// logs out arnold.oneLiners[4]

/* Then Carl Weathers high fived Arnold and the world was saved from Batman.

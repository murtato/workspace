# Arnold's Moronic Script

![mr.freeze](assets/freezearnold.jpg)

## Constructor Functions Lab

Arnold wrote the worst script. Before he follows through with it all, you need to model it for him in JS so he can tell how terrible it is.

You can find the `starter_code/` directory in your class repo.

##### Two options for this lab:

1. I found a copy of Arnold's script and included it in the starter code. Please fill out the "script" and model the screenplay so Arnold can tell how terrible his ideas really are.
2. Rewrite Arnold's script! If you choose the more open path, you must:
   - Use constructor functions and references to other objects in your version of his film.
   - Use at least 3 constructor functions
   - Create at least 15 instances of your constructor functions

__BONUS__: Add functions to the prototype of your different constructor functions.

How to use an array to check for winner
Set all boxes to the same class attribute <button class = "box">
set up an array with the winning combinations
[0 1 2, 3 4 5, 6 7 8, 0 3 6, 1 4 7, 2 5 8, 0 4 8, 2 4 6]
assign variable to the array of tiles
var tiles = document.getElementByClassName
run For Loop for winCombos
for Combo in winCombos
    if tiles[combo(0)] == tiles[combo(1)] == tiles[combo(2)]
    && tiles[combo(0)] != ""...
        return tiles[combo(0)]
      "X" or "O" depending on who's on tile
--> Combo(0) will check the array [0 1 2], corresponding to the arrays within the larger array
